So, my grandma invented the cross stitch patent and some people really
screwed her in business that she thought she went into with a partner
Martha Stewart, but it was only Martha in name, and not Ms. Stewart,
as well, if you go to a Joanne Fabrics and look ath the cross sititch
they sell today, they are like on computer crack and no fun for truth.
full scale 16 million color converted mural images and not the sew fun.

Get it? No sew fun.

DIMENSIONS!  Anyway, I hear a echo of her business before she passed,
it says, yes, party toys, someone she asked to help her produce cross
stitchs already done to be sold that way, ended up CNC researching her
new bsuiness, their lazy 3D printing alternative!  Anyway, I had too
thought, one thread to rule all assembly line production movements of
finihsed cross stitches on those labrynth marble game style cartridge.
That nees capital to help her after what the Martha probably relieved
isn't Martha giving it back to her, and so I made a program KadPatch
to design cross stitch patterns traditional like without all the could
be more then a simple drawing program where the art creativity shines.
However, one last feature it does not yet compile the pattern and key
into PDF's portable ready to print out in large printers or portions.
