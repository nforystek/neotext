So, my grandma invented the cross stitch patent and some people really
screwed her in business that she thought she went into with a partner
Martha Stewart, but it was only Martha in name, and not Ms. Stewart,
as well, if you go to a Joanne Fabrics and look ath the cross sititch
they sell today, they are like on computer crack and no fun for truth.
full scale 16 million color converted mural images and not the sew fun.

Get it? No sew fun.

DIMENSIONS!  Anyway, I hear a echo of her business before she passed,
it says, yes, party toys, someone she asked to help her produce cross
stitch already done to be sold that way, ended up CNC researching her
new bsuiness, their lazy 3D printing alternative!  Anyway, I had too
thought, one thread to rule all assembly line production movements of
finihsed cross stitches on those labrynth marble game style cartridge.
That needs capital to help her after what the Martha probably relieved
isn't Ms Stewart gets it back to her, and so I made a program KadPatch
to design cross stitch patterns traditional like without all the could
be more then a simple drawing program where the art creativity shines.
However, one last feature it does not yet compile the pattern and key
into PDF's portable ready to print out in large printers or portions.

I had a dream that, when those parents that raised me died, I walked
into a room with 4 to 6 elderly ladies sitting aound in typical older
victorian furtinute, modern house nothing special but a house for gals
like these ladies, juist a day room, and I felt so alone in the world
I didn't know anyone in the room but that wasn't why, it was just that
it made me feel like any other non immediate in-law relatives home as
visited, real dry and void of presence I know or identify with.  Then
my grand ma come in the room from already in the home and immediately
it was like everytime I was at her home, not much comfortable there too
but her personality just made me feel welcome as if it was her home.
Lit up everything and this weight comes off all of a sudden I feel like
I know all the ladies is they are haning out with my grandma glows up.

Yet I was also unsettled when I woke because she's that, not my in-law
parents were as humbling or inviting, betraying if I had to guess and
a lot drawn on longer then it had to be, if I stood a contest to them.

If I had to guess where I need to be to be healthy in heaven it is within
Grandma's warm food embrace like nothing else, and I felt like blocked in.

To feel like your inhailing the best water in the world at a consumption
rate, but your really eating food, is to have no hot, cold or abrasion
pain as you chew, and how does she doe it?  It's not me, I like a Dorito
but let's be honest, I've been stabbed by those so hard I cut my mouth.
