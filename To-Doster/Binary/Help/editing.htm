  <P>
Above is the window that will show when you click "Edit" it is very similar to the "Add" window except the title will say "Edit Entry" so that at anytime you know which action you selected during your actions.
	</P>




  <P>
In this window the Date/Time in which you add the item will be locked in.
	</P>


  <P>
The next field shows what product this entry tends to and is not changeable.
	</P>


  <P>
The type field is where you may select which kind of control tracking the entry you are editing will be.  For completion purposes this option is still available to be switched to be precise if the issue happens to be further of a realization known that can flare other new change control tickets.
	</P>

  <P>
The comment field will be locked to what ever is currently set for the change control ticket and does not allow changing it; however it does allow adding on to the end of the current comment during an edit.
	</P>

  <P>
The last field is the status of the change control ticket itself.   Possible options are "Open, Fixed, Re-Opened, and closed."  So long as a ticket is not closed, it is still considered active and visible.  Once a ticket as been properly tested or completed, it should be set to close which will hide it from the main list of tickets, unless the "Closed" check box is check.  A "Re-Open" status shouldn't occur with out already having been a ticket in the "Open" status.  A "Fixed" status is used to indicate retesting or analyzing, it pertains to tickets that are of type "Change" and "Fix."  "Closed" becomes the final destination of the ticket, whether it is "Fixed" or even just no longer an issue in sequence.
