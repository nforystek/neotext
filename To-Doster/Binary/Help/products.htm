  <P>
	When To-Doster is installed under the start menu items created there is a folder labeled "Configure" which has two shortcuts under it.  One of them is labeled "Edit Products."  Choosing this option allows you to setup which products To-Doster will list when you are creating change control entries.  Note, only one instance of To-Doster should be running at any one time between the main usage application and the configuration shortcuts.
