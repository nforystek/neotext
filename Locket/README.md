Windows Desktop Utility Titles; Locket

A pretty strong in encryption, all be it the concept rather outdated, password locket to hold passwords and files.

Designed to just run off the USB, readily opening in any Windows OS configuration Win ME or later, there maybe even

a finger print option setup by the /fp switch after you initially create your database, which is super simple right

at the first login window.  Images and such that you view don't go on the system your running it on, idle auto closes.

I just rnoticed it still has blue certificate rep.  I vowed not to compile it ever again after I felt I was intruded.

The encryption uses all three RC/DS and NC together.  I named it after the USB I put on a necklace that was my locket.

I bought an actual USB of a major card/flash drive brand and have both on the USB, it seems their's stopped working.
