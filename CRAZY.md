Some guy across the world is wondering why his compiler is erroring and changing the lowercase error letter to upper case is working.  Then the precompiler directive of -1 and 0 rather then 1 and 0 is still C++ thought, is shoving it a charactrer error again for faster code after compiled verses smaller code after compiled a toggle band to warp the enumerator declares all the way down the moudle scope and back due to a commandline condition verses, module level.  CRAZY

Let me try to BE COOL HUNNYA BUN BE COOL...

#Const False=0
#Const True=-1


In fact let me find out they are trying to stop compile time signing, by signing the compiler, before everyone left VB6. Then it's on like "Donkey Kong!"  Come and big it!  Biggot, is that how you say it?
