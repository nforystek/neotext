   Typical Media</H3>
  <P>
When you have an image in your media library, it is then available to be used by the interface shown above. To enable use you must check the checkbox nearest the entry you're editing. Clicking the cactus and sun icon will allow you to select the image you want from your media library. Clicking the red X will remove any selected image you have selected; this is different then just having the checkbox unchecked in the HTML reference.
