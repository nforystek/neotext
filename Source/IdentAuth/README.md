#IdentAuth

Designed to respond to IDENT challenge properly with no, or little setup on it's part, as well work with its self

behind a intranet designee incoming challenges and route to mutliple clients with this installed.  Besides network

setup on your networks behalf, this does all the work for correct response and removal of the ~ on /whois in IRC.

If you have the IDENT port open on your firewall and are a single client just install this and turn off your client's

IDENT and you wont get the tilda on your /whois, which also means your devulding correct information of your userID.

If your running multiple clients behind a firewall in a intranet, with each running the application, set the imconing

IDENT port requests to just one client and they all will respond correctly, again granted the client IDENT freeform

entery is is turned turned off from responding.  mIRC or Klient what have you.  This can get you into the efnet back-

door, for proper repsonse timing in closing when when RFC said close.  There is a weird hand crafted one chance only

to get it write copy and paste banner in the under layer of efnet when the other clinets ping you as you connect up.
