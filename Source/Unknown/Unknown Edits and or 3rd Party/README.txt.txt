Max-FTP (Ahead v2) - Unknown 3rd party software titled similar.  Neotext Max-FTP concept was v1, and internally v2 is a actual working model of released to any downloadbale provider as first version available then was v3 and it was   A version not beta of v3 was eventually released that had full feature allowances of the application, that was very early and basic to the prospect GUI that still the title consists of today lacxking no feature or option prior.

Max-FTP v3.0 (Beta3) - Unkown 3rd party and personal security breech warning went on njot found. This is not Neotext software, it has evidence of a injected registration or purchase window, denoted by the discoloring of the system defaults in Windows automatic colord, as well, Neotext beta version follows the beta reason to version, which is, not finished, or early access then by liabilty not purchasble and one more, cripples in a time period to extinguish.

Max-FTP v5.1 (Hack) - This is a key generator or patch hack for v5.1.  Neotext Max-FTP version 4 was not released, as it was preliminary attempt to rewrite Max-FTP starting from the floor, and achieve v5.1 window layout, however architectually not fit after a first semi-full rewrite, the visual concept was taken and rewrote once more from the start resulting in v5x and then later it is the first and only purchasable version of Neotext Max-FTP software.

maxftp_XiaZaiBa - This is a 3rd party's title of a similar by protocol or likely ftp as it says, type of downloading software. It appears to be non offensive to the task, as in not malicious or intended to some other use rather then the GUI appears, and tailored maybe something specific to a operational need like most and every other ftp software that runs in the crowd and keeps standing on it's feet overall.  It simply is named similar, and seem to have smaller non extensive development.
