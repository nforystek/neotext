This folder showcases bunk or invalid (merely by 3rd party but for searching on the name) versions of Neotext's Max-FTP.  Even the ones that were/are from Neotext are bunk today.  The reason this is done onyl with this title is that the encumbering overall development of my in a modular approch, umbrellas with the title Max-FTP, for instance it uses 100% of DLL libraries that any or all other application titles I write may also be using.  SO much so, it is 100% redundat in the fact it has a IDE in the native script language it is written in, and that is where the development is at.  Therefore merely the scope of project is the reason this title is chosen to show this research from a past more prelevent to downloads and availability certified that only recently 2021-2024 has taken back seat to cost at a whole 30$ a month to self service, which is how now it is Github, I think the best option.
