Contined in this folder are versions that were Neotext officially whether released or not, and are not operational today for any reason.


	Max-FTP v4.1.30
	Max-FTP v5.2


Max-FTP v4.1.30 - Not released, and when installed today, has a initial media file error, something like as if the skin feature is missing a graphic.  I put it here because decompiling VB code is quite simple if you were to want to see what the architecture challenege was in the window lay out that becamse developed to a point of having to start over at the beginning again, and lead to version 5. THe bulk of the internal actual operation is not, it was stopped and became a model for the window outline for 5.2.

Max-FTP v5.2 - The version that was purchasable and therefore likely has a shareware or cripple ware about it if you don't register.  This is an attempt to encompase the window architecture of version 4, but the scheduling and said window model did not reach the actual potential power attempted to attain by this release, 6 has addressed that fully and encompassed seemlessly into servicing and all.
