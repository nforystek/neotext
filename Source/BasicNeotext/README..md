It is very difficult to get an Add-On to behave with out condemning the environment into more trouble then it's worth,

as well not obtrusivly making anyhting in efforts going out of the way for such, and continue a prompt readily original

nature use of the environment.  I have to be honest, I crash VB6 a lot, and that was the more difficult triump in tool

bar buttons disappearing but I seem to have licked it, and I continue to use my Add-On (sort of, not as much since I no

longer sign) and it has not made me need to resort back to the environment so I am happy with my production of it.

I kid you not the global memory the way the VBIDE compiles for fast code or less size knocks on the opening door of

the C2.EXE object linker at put a dash in on 1 or 0 in #define, technically #Const and whacks the enumeration declare

and usability of modulated #const, so what I did was make the environment attempt to tightly remove all spaces in

compile directives to accomodate the -1 but there isn't a great way of acheievement because the properties window puts

the spaces back in automatically. so VBIDE=-1 vs. VBIDE = -1 solves the entry door way the comprise compiles #defines.
