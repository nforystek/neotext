It is very difficult to get an Add-On to behave with out condemning the environment into more trouble then it's worth,

as well not obtrusivly making anyhting in efforts going out of the way for such, and continue a prompt readily original

nature use of the environment.  I have to be honest, I crash VB6 a lot, and that was the more difficult triump in tool

bar buttons disappearing but I seem to have licked it, and I continue to use my Add-On (sort of, not as much since I no

longer sign) and it has not made me need to resort back to the environment so I am happy with my production of it.
