	A Windows Service capable of all Win98 or newer Windows OS, also

2.	Memory architecture exposed project embedding, single thread multi-
	instances. Measures in place, and removes precompiled variable spaces.
	Safe guards project collision. Options of settings lock, build output.

3.	Use Uninstall.exe in VB98 to reverse the changes to VB98 installation
	also access the "BasicNeotext 3.0" uninstall program from Control Panel.
	All changes reverse and your VisualStudio is not modified only settings.

4.	Execute VBN.EXE with the /? command line switches to get more option info.
	There is a formal front end that runs per instance which acts naturally
	as if it's not there, includes text editor able batch/script processor.
