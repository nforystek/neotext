<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>BasicNeotext</span> installs two project
templates to the Template folder located in the Visual Basic installation that
will appear when you are prompted and asked which project you want to start at
the new project dialog creation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of
these projects is&nbsp;a Service Capable project that uses the Microsoft
developed rare ActiveX component named <span class=SpellE>ntsvc.ocx</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was originally downloaded from Microsoft
Downloads but only available for a short period of time and by itself, not
included in software packages like Service Packs for Visual Studio.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This OCX is primarily for Windows NT based
service abilities but the Windows Service Project Template with <span
class=SpellE>BasicNeotext</span> as been built into a wrapper functioning
Service just as well on Windows 98 and ME systems with enforcing the same
standard as a Windows NT system requires, such as internal basis of restricting
install and uninstall to the service itself as only capable of when the module
is correctly expressing it’s own operations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This and property rich ethic of thorough conduct requiring the name and
description to be featured in the registry with the service information are key
natures to debugging Windows services and they have been made to attempt of
keeping it one interface for a major differences in MS-DOS way of Windows
system services and all NT or higher based ways.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A unique key unique quality of this services
design is the able unattended execution of thus with the object consistency of
failure to remain holding Visual Basic up and running, giving the design aspect
of full featured capability to the service development.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other sense of the words, it does not need
forms to occur the development cycle nor does it need the “End” statement for project
relinquishing of resources.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Upon start
it assumes nothing of overhead on entry to Sub Main.</p>
