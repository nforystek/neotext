<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal>A causality of normal development design is precompiled
conditional statements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes one
may have noticed that Enumerator or logic OR and AND bitwise descriptive words
are at a failure to function correctly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is even more so evident with the declinational sections of Visual
basic when your precompiled conditional #IF and #Else blocks are put to the
module name test and leave the declarative or even more complex, cross over out
of declarative module sections.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every
module name in the Visual Basic environment should be defined in naturally by
conditional #IF checking for it with just use of nulls, such as “#IF &lt;module
name&gt; Then” would only evaluate to the IF block when &lt;module name&gt;
exists as a .BAS file.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Through passing
over and beyond the declarative portion of a module differences in the next
module or multiple ones, can be noted into 100% failure and Enumerators as well
as bitwise descriptive or legend based with just numerical expression ordinal,
as offset into total failure to be IntelliSense and scope actively through out
all class and module scopes not persistently correct and alerting erratic
syntax checks of not found. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This in my
professional opinion is contributed to three factors of design improperly thoroughly
completed of resolve in cases of conduct.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One factor is the optimization of the code in the properties, there is a
fast and a small option that is a major offset dismount load to any improper
alignment of a single consistent bit not projected by the precompiled
conditional variables from the compile to the entire project. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The second contributing factor in my
professional opinion is the inclusion of spaces into the visual basic
properties window, when you setup precompiled variables.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The environment places spaces between the
equals sign and the value, as well as the colon if you have multiple
variables.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tightening up these and
removing the spaces whether a command line compile or compilation with the
environment is the key contributing factor to they may not be presently pressed
against the compiling machine coded output, having any space jots the actual
bit imbalance of uses of native data types where as the visual basic native for
true is a negative one, in preconditioned compile, the insurrection of it is
not native a single one, like it is a single zero and must be pushed against
the formal language memory size obstructively, there fore as well, so would a
space in-between also be considerably like a #define in C, everything beyond it
goes to the depicter. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Noticing that from
a command line it would entail not these spaces that are automatically formatted
for continence in the properties window, I have designed BasicNeotext to remove
them from between variable the equals size the actual data value and multiple variables
separated by the colon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a
formality upon opening a project with BasicNeotext that considers it and all
batch files in and dub routinely through the child folders that will check for theses
spaces in precondition compile variables and remove them, upon live editing of them
in the properties window, they as well are removed before the okay button is
committed.</p>
