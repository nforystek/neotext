			<Char_Desc_2000>RemindMe is the schedule ANYTHING software, from running tasks, to pizza timers, to acting like an alarm clock RemindMe will handle your software scheduling needs. RemindMe runs as a windows service seperate from the user interface so if you don't have RemindMe open, or even if you logged out of your computer, RemindMe is still operating.  All the basic scheduling operations can be easily done with the easy to use wizard interface. However, if you need something a bit more powerful RemindMe also allows simplistic scripting in VBScript and JavaScript with out getting in the way of complicating the interface.</Char_Desc_2000>
