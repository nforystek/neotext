I will never compile this application again.  It has much to be desired and isn't much useful to large named companies handling passwords, it is just that, I found a injection garbage entry, able I just delete it but it slows significantly by about 20% during encryptions if I merely compile it again.  It uses three encryptions in a cascading importance manor from the entry password of MS databases password to your own personalizing the interior of a access 97 database.  I just really think I starved the competition with wont compile it again.  Looking like their waiting on something the injection record didn't preform, and so now haul the whole RS encryption over cooked to fry mine with defeated. I.D.K., could be the changes I didn't but do. I don't even want to show the code it is so messy, as part of a deferential thwart, I just go fast and messy to help security it's own.
