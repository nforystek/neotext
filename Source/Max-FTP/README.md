#Max-FTP

My longest standing project that I develop, and sort of a umbrella factor to most all Neotext projects what not with the

scope of modulation in my code derivatives and robust larger measures of project and executable fashioning to fine tuning.

The GUI doesn't change much for quite some time, ever since version 4 modeled but only 5 actaully operated, 6 has been the

same moral view and only gets better underneath.  For instance the multi windows design it appears was not operational at

multiple windows in the scheduling factor during version 5, but now it is that and a whole lot more in the servcie department

not much of what is visible.  There is also a IDE included, that I can't get enough of, but the overall project lacks in SSL.

I did start to really crack down and v3 SSL get to it, but I've stopped and mostly due to I wanted it self signed three of

a kind from delivery to diligence in able proceed unsafe as invalid authority but something happened and I can't afford real

SSL after long, I coulnd't afford keeping the webserver payment, so here at Github, I rathernot sign anyway, it was nerve

racking not up on all the services, because then I know their not working together in cryptology self signed or not, also

I'm ont proceeding off 32bit OS for complining anyway because I can't stand seeing "this app no longers runs it's not your

fault."  My JavaScript teacher stressed cross browser platform, apply that to my C teacher said "backward compatability."

You have your answer.  No you didn't.  Allow invalid authority at the hand of the user IF you mark 3 in cahin build to run.

Fine, big bag brother super low ball single certificate self sign only auth and buy it at always a version price better is.
