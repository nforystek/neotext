#Max-FTP

My longest standing project that I develop, and sort of a umbrella factor to most all Neotext projects what not with the

scope of modulation in my code derivatives and robust larger measures of project and executable fashioning to fine tuning.

The GUI doesn't change much for quite some time, ever since version 4 modeled but only 5 actaully operated, 6 has been the

same moral view and only gets better underneath.  For instance the multi windows design it appears was not operational at

multiple windows in the scheduling factor during version 5, but now it is that and a whole lot more in the servcie department

not much of what is visible.  There is also a IDE included, that I can't get enough of, but the overall project lacks in SSL.
