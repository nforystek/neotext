This is one of the coolest places, I have to go over it again thorough to see if the puzzle is still working

last I checked it didn't but I also had a bunch of test mock going on for remaking it in a different project

with all vbScript instead of whatever that attempt is what I did have going here, it's not so robust a lang.

Your a chess piece at a deserted Roman oasis carved out of a endless cliff near the ocean blue and, well,

as you move around there are EARTH, WIND, WATER and FIRE written at the bottom of the screen, wtih IVX's

under them, and the goal is to turn each element word from white to terqouise based on whatever interactions

you can find or think up of which are notably occuring to the IVX, until you lock in a word and all four wins.
