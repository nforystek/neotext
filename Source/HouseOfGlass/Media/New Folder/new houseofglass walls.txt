Planning if may, use thses images to make the HouseoFGlass a confined structure with these as walls, the vortex as floor and the lightening storm as ceilling, and maybe make a element able of two floors about it.  Or spooky boo ghosts in the glass that are hidden.  Maybe the other carnival panoramic for just outside entry to the game.
