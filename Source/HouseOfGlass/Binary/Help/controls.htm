Use the controls to manuver around the House Of Glass until you find the exit.  You will be timed as soon as you step out of the start area, upon entering the end area your score and the best score will be displayed.  At this time you can replay the level using F1 or go to the next level using F2.  Any level you have already played may be skipped using F3.<Br>
