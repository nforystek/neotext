# Blacklawn

This is a role playing game if you play on a multiplayer, similar setup to the style Quake servers run,

and modeled much on it in attempt to feature rich it with a console and ability to record, but the play

is nothing like such, there's no people, the objective is to get lost however you see fit in variant

ways there is a chain of score means that will put on in however many ways you find from 0 to 9, some

have depth, for instance the first 1 and 2, comprize of three timers, like random warp into the black

ness and the timer begins, so finding your way back is anyones guess, and more for show rather then a

numerical score, there are multi parts to some scores, like for instance you can ride away from the lawn

that you start the game at by yourself and loose it, which is two timers in different, for which what a

score maybe obtained.  The playing character is a twisted metal that looks like "Wings" with a intro

story on how it comes to be your moving, and there are power ups power downs, things hidding in total

utter unfathomably large blackness all except this little tiny two road two bulding grass deserted gas

station in the middle of nowhere, and from there is anyones guess how to obtain scores 0 through 9.

As multiplayer you can bring your single player score with and gloat or find ways to upgrade your bot,

you can start fresh in multiplayer and gloat that way, with out loosing your single player score chain.
