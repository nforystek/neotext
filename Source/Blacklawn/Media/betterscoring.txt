X = sit around, don't move
1 = design up to three nth
2 = stacking ship move mod
3 = stacking counter score
4 = coin collect aft allow
5 = ship stock major docks
6 = absolute void fail tow
N = total chain achievment



coin collecting allows you mulligan in combos taking counter score hits for tokens
when started into a scoring chain by X or 1 counter turning on all 1 through 6 are
changed from player states and characteristic achievements to active counting unit
1 to 3 are continuously set challenges with the ships ability to meneuvar from aft
movements to pushing and falling or warp and porting where as the seal of frist in
1 to 3 determine how ordering 4 to 6 goes on and so on back to 1 to 3 in tripplets
in easy to difficult the numericals will change their position in each sets thrird
and posture the numbers next to them should it be lowering or excelling the scores
most score attempts will end up in falling out returning back to show achievements
and coin upon none swift clocking will take hits by the bounty full and gaining of
them will be easily by the many from being around when taking it to level four the
score can be finished by barely occuring action and depending on how well one ship
started is how toll high the higher score may reflect and keep reflect by show 123
5 will be magnificient ship wins for parts or ship itself and six is its easy fail
