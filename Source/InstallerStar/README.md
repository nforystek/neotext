# InstallerStar

This is a installation packaging app that I developed which utilizes Microsoft's IEXPRESS and Nullsoft's Install System.

Features; Restore point creation, roll back, and no hassle single file internet installation for downloads because getting

to downloads these days already hassles enough.  On the other hand is a GUI if it is packed in multiple files for floppy.

I wanted to see my applications fit on old floppy, don't ask why I just think it's neat, like taking a taxi to get anywhere,

or that is cabs, when your Bently crashed.  Another aim of it was the ability to include EVERY library ability you could

possibly have need from Win ME and above, cross Win platform it is capable to do libraries.  But my installs for purpose

just got very large so I did opt out.  If I were to make a CD-ROM version I think I would opt back in as it makes for

thorough completeness in all Win variant OS that it will up and run in distant future unknown, that's the goal, looking

back and not finding "This file does not appear to be a EXE" type of "This application requires dot NET and 64bit" fails.

It also utilizes command line infrastructure of my IDE add-on todo packing it, I don't know how pratical it is in others

actaully considering trying to pack their program with this, as alot of it is system tailored to command line and routine.

I don't know what logo testing would say, I had only two warnings about file properties and DPI on the first time I tested

but with out the committie further my installs were solely using Nullsoft's Install System then, and I've changed to this.
