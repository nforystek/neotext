SoSweet's a whitespace language most comparable to markups or styling type of interest, absent the ability of actual change of anything it is presented.  The actual stance of whether it should carry the qualities of such was given very close and careful thought and decided on never, for the sake of code and text in a real world situation of the author of bad news, will never thy alter (not even case sensitivity).  It's simply, for lack of a better understanding, color coding of foreground text.  The idea is for a cover all purpose, but not present all purposed with-in the realm of language possibilities.  Standing out quite simply in underwrite it does nothing but occur in the white space around text and is with-in text uniformily. While may it be English or a computer language as part of the render, the realm of projecting langauge in flow is the colors ability.


The indication that it may alter a word is creation of text in
it at itself, thus even as little as an edit like a case letter correction where it isn't case sensitive is still alterations. Static state rendering possibilities (applied not in real time) of altering have context among the syntax abilities by example. Dynamic rendered altering (real time like many modern IDE's)
has no place in implementation coloring a visual only feign.
